# Ethiopian Medical Data Platform

![Data Pipeline Architecture](docs/pipeline_architecture.png) *(placeholder for architecture diagram)*

An end-to-end data platform that extracts medical business insights from public Telegram channels in Ethiopia, processes the data through a modern ELT pipeline, and exposes analytical insights via API.

## üöÄ Features

- **Telegram Data Scraping**: Collect messages and images from public medical channels
- **Data Lake Storage**: Store raw data in a structured, partitioned format
- **PostgreSQL Data Warehouse**: Reliable storage with optimized schema
- **dbt Transformations**: Clean, model, and document data using best practices
- **YOLO Object Detection**: Enrich image data with detected medical products
- **FastAPI Analytics**: RESTful endpoints for business insights
- **Dagster Orchestration**: Reliable pipeline scheduling and monitoring

## üìä Business Questions Answered

1. Top 10 most mentioned medical products/drugs across channels
2. Price/availability variations of specific products
3. Channels with most visual content (pills vs. creams)
4. Daily/weekly trends in health-related posting volume
